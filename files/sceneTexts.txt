This is a cube called Kyube
He is an exploration fanatic
>
Then once...
>
Looking at the castle, he decided to check it out
>

>
On his way to the castle,
He came across his friends
They then decide to go together
>
After a long walk, they reached the castle
>
All excited, red and green cube decided to move
Then followed by Kyube
>
The 2 cubes open the door and ran inside
saying "I want the treasure!"
>
Kyube decided to go after his friends,
potentially teaching them a thing or two
>
There Kyube saw green cube in a corner
The green cube was pretty scared
>
Kyube went to him and relieved him
>
Kyube: Where have you been red?
Red: I've found treasure
I won't be sharing treasure with you
>
Kyube & Green: Hey! Not fair
We were going to share the treasure
Red: Ok! If you can win against me
Then I'll let you have the treasure
>
Red: (angry) I won't share treasure
>
Kyube smacks red to the ground
>
Red: (unhappy) Fine!
I'll share the treasure I found
>
And So Kyube, Green and Red
Share the treasure they found!
